## The Exercise:

Implement a simplified supermarket checkout system. It should offer an API with at least one endpoint that takes a
checkout cart and returns the total price of the contained items. The cart can contain any number and combination of
available items, in any order. Additionally the checkout system should support weekly offers, where an offer defines a
number of items that are discounted when bought together. For example: one apple costs 0.30€, but 2 apples are offered
at 0.45€. These offers should be applied automatically during checkout.
